- ✅ **macOS** (macOS 10.14+)
- ✅ **Linux** (Ubuntu 18.04+)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Management
- **Provider** pattern for state management
- Reactive UI updates with `Consumer` widgets
- Centralized data providers for energy data and themes

### Networking
- **HTTP** client for REST API communication
- **Socket.IO** client for real-time WebSocket connections
- Automatic retry logic and error handling
- Connection state management

### Data Models
```dart
// Campus model with location and energy sources
class Campus {
  final String id, name;
  final Location location;
  final EnergySources energySources;
}

// Real-time energy data
class EnergyData {
  final SolarData solar;
  final WindData wind;
  final BatteryData battery;
  final GridData grid;
  final LoadData load;
  final WeatherData weather;
}
```

### Services
- `ApiService` - REST API communication
- `SocketService` - WebSocket real-time updates
- `LoggingService` - Comprehensive logging system

### UI Components
- `EnergyOverviewCards` - Key metrics display
- `EnergyChartWidget` - Interactive data visualization
- `CampusSelector` - Campus switching interface
- `ConnectionStatusWidget` - Real-time connection status

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Configure your backend URL in `lib/constants/app_constants.dart`:

```dart
class ApiConfig {
  static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000';
  static const String productionUrl = 'https://api.grevo.energy';
}
```

### Themes
The app supports both light and dark themes with energy-focused color schemes:
- **Light Theme**: Green primary with clean whites
- **Dark Theme**: Eco-friendly greens with dark backgrounds

## 📝 API Integration

### Required Endpoints
```
GET  /api/campuses              # List all campuses
GET  /api/campuses/:id          # Get specific campus
GET  /api/energy-data           # Get energy data with filters
GET  /api/energy-data/latest/:campusId  # Get latest data
GET  /api/health                # Server health check
```

### WebSocket Events
```
// Client -> Server
join-campus         # Subscribe to campus updates
leave-campus        # Unsubscribe from campus
get-latest-data     # Request latest data

// Server -> Client
energy-data         # Real-time energy data
system-alert        # System notifications
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Check if backend server is running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check firewall settings

2. **No Data Displayed**
   - Ensure backend has campus data configured
   - Check API endpoints are responding
   - Verify data format matches models

3. **Build Errors**
   - Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Check Flutter/Dart SDK versions
   - Verify all dependencies are compatible

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in `lib/services/logging_service.dart` to see detailed logs.
